# The Situation #

- Libraries are beginning to [digitize their collections](http://digitizedmedievalmanuscripts.org/maps/heat-maps/)
- Some of these collections are going on the internet
- And some of those are made available under Creative Commons Licenses 
- How do we best take advantage of these resources

# Conclusions #

- More resources are at our fingertips than ever before. We need to be thoughtful about how we use them and we need to increase our access to more and more resources.
- We also need to consider who can now do research and the kinds of skills they need to be taught in order to do productive research
